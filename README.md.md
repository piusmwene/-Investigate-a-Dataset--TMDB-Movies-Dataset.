# Project: Investigate a Dataset -TMDB Movies Dataset.

## Indroduction
This is my first data analyst project at Udacity. I used real world data to investigate if there is an effect between voting average and revenue adjusted. To find out how many movies project were relaesed by the  company. Finally, if the popularity of movies have an impact on the adjusted revenue. 

### Data Description
The main aim of this project is to analyze data using python. I will use a 5000 TMDB Movies data set containing the movie information. The dataset contains more than 10000 movies with 21 variables which include: id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genre, production_companies, relase_date, vote_count, vote_avergae, release year, budget_adj, and revenue_adj. I have selected the adjusted revenue as a dependent variable.The voting average, popularity, and year release are my independent variables for data analysis in this project.

### Python libraries used to complete the project in the juypter notebook include:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib.pyplot
